![Plant Palace Header](https://github.com/darothmedia/plant-palace/blob/main/plant-palace-logo.png "Plant Palace Logo")

### **Background**

In 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, you decided to replace the void of physical human interaction with plants. A LOT of plants. Now, deep into 2021, your apartment has become cluttered with plant pots, plant shelves, hanging gardens, kitchen grow lights, and more. It’s gotten so bad that it’s hard to even walk to the kitchen (or, to translate for the New Yorkers among us: the mini fridge and microwave). Now, every time you need to move around your apartment, you need to move your plants out of the way! Why not get rid of some, you ask? Well, would you get rid of your human children? Absolutely not!


### **Overview**

Your apartment is a rectangular grid, something like this:

The game is structured like the classic “Traffic Jam” game, where you need to move cars out of the way in order to clear a path. In this case, the player will be given an objective, like:

**I need to pee! Clear a path from the bedroom to the bathroom**

There will be lots of plants obstructing the path. Move them out of the way so your player avatar can safely move to the target location.


### **Functionality & MVPs**

In Plant Palace, users will be able to:



* Start, pause, and reset the game board
* Move plants on a top-down 2D grid (up down right left)
* Move a player on the grid (up down right left)
* Receive objectives & view the timer for the given objective

In addition, this project will include:



* Canvas objects:
    * Plants (top down)
    * Human avatar (top down)
    * Boundaries (walls, furniture)
* New game / restart buttons
* An about & Instructions modal
* A production README


### **Wireframes**


### **Technologies, Libraries, APIs**

This project will implement the following technologies:



* Canvas API: to render the game board
* Webpack to bundle the source JS code
* Phaser 3 JS game framework for user input control
